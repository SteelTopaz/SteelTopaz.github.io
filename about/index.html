        <h1>About PLADD</h1>
        <span class="date-author">important things you probably need to know</span>
        <p>I live in Austin, Texas, with my wife and dog. I'm trying to make up for a college spent playing  far too many video games by writing, coding, and learning to draw. Hey, look! That covers four of the six categories up in that there navigation bar! And this section, too, since it's writing.</p>
        
        <p>Anyway, I created this site to share what I do, learn more about web design, and remove "MAKE A PERSONAL WEBSITE ALREADY" from my "things I probably totally need to do at some point" list.</p>
        
        <p>Other things to know about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I do all the cooking. Cooking is fun!</li>
            <li>I like to mow the yard with a reel mower instead of a gas or electric motor. It's fun when grass shoots out the back.</li>
            <li>I'm not 100% certain that the comma after "Texas" in that first paragraph is necessary or grammatically correct, but it looked weird to _not_ have it.</li>
            <li>I deleted and re-started this section of the website probably five times before deciding how to present myself.</li>
            <li>I am a homeowner. It happened much earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am a landlord. This also happened much earlier than I expected, which was never.</li>
            <li>Christin was the first person ever to call me "Pladd," on the bus home from the first day of 7th grade. I don't know why I remember this event so well. If you are Christin and you have a copyright complaint for my usage of PLADD, please contact my lawyer.</li>
            <li>I do not have a lawyer.</li>
            <li>Wait, my brother is a lawyer. Does that count? Christin, talk to my brother.</li>
            <li>I completed 25-man ICC pre-Cata. Afterward, I felt like I had beaten World of Warcraft and stopped playing. I started dating my wife a few months later. COINCIDENCE? Yes.</li>
            <li>I have a vegetable garden, and I feel oddly satisfied seeing the plants grow freely without being harvested. Yes, my lovelies! RUN FREE.</li>
            <li>I have never seen Zoolander.</li>
        </ul>
