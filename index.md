    alt: "The TrustRadius logo, a stylized 'TR' followed by the word 'TrustRadius'. The stylized 'TR' appears to be made of a folded blue ribbon. One side of the ribbon is a light blue, the other side is a dark blue. The visual contrast from the two colors gives the logo an illusory depth, as if it was three-dimensional. The word 'TrustRadius' itself is formed from standard letters in a dark blue."

    alt: "The Capensis logo, a stylized outline of a long-eared hare. The hare is rendered in dark blue strokes in a calligraphic style, with varying line widths. The hare appears to be resting on the ground: its belly lies flat to the ground, its front legs stretch forwards, and its back legs curl underneath its body. The head of the hare is up, with its long ears arcing over its back. It appears to be calmly surveying its surroundings."

    alt: "The icon we used for the Rehearsal Room project. The icon's style is minimalistic, with clean horizontal and vertical lines. Most of the icon is a square with lines drawn inside it. The shape is the simplified top-down layout of a room, using lines to represent walls and openings to represent doors. To the left of the square is a colored vertical line with arrows on each end pointing up and down, giving the impression of a measurement in the Y dimension. A similar line runs horizontally underneath the square, giving the impression of a measurement in the X dimension."
