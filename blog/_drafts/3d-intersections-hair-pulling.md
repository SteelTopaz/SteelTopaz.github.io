title: "3D Intersections Are Maddening"

Thank goodness, I thought. The nightmare was over. I was done with [dissections]({% post_url 2016-02-26-textures-part-two %}). I had stopped dreaming of lamprey watermelons everywhere, appearing when you least expect them. It would be smooth sailing from here on out, because that is how life works: you finish somehing hard, and then everything else is easy forever.

Yeah, I should have seen that coming. This exercise was no less tedious or difficult than the previous, and I messed it up _so hard_. And what better way to learn from my mistakes than to broadcast them to everyone I know, and possibly people that I don't know?

### The Assignment ###

It'll be hard to understand just how badly I borked this exercise without a proper introduction. As always, you can see the whole exercise on the [Draw A Box website](http://drawabox.com/lesson/2) (look for "Part 3: Form Intersections" on that page).

Irshad Karim, the creator of Draw A Box, teaches a specific style of drawing called [constructional drawing](http://drawabox.com/article/construction). Constructional drawing stands slightly apart from _observational drawing_. With observational drawing, you draw exactly what you see without necessarily considering the three-dimensional composition of your subject. Again, you're attempting to draw what you see _exactly_ as you see it.

Constructional drawing, on the other hand, asks you to find the fundamental underlying shapes that your subject is composed of, and then figure out how those shapes combine in three-dimensional space. Planes Boxes. Cylinders. Cones. Spheres. By understanding how they relate to each other in three dimensions, you can use fundamental shapes to construct a rough model of your subject, and then build from there, adding layers of progressively finer detail.

The goal of constructional drawing isn't necessarily to capture something you see. Instead, the goal is to "convey a message through visual means," as Karim puts it. It doesn't have to be perfect or entirely true to life: as longs as it effectively communicates what you want it to, then you've achieved the basic goal.

I've greatly simplified both kinds of drawing, because I imagine some of you have already snapped your monitors in half due to boredom. "I ain't interested in no comparison and contrastation of varying approaches to drawing!" you yell to your monitor, which is lying on the ground questioning its life decisions. "I'm here to see Paul tear down his own works!"

I get you, Angry Strawman.
