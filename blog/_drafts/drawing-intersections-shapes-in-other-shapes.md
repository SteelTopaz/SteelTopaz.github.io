Paul drew more intersections! Look at those things up there. Those are definitely representative of all of the intersections I drew. They all look perfect and wonderful and great. Gosh golly what a good job I did. I can promise you that none of them look like this:



Okay, fine. So I may have made a few mista&em;



Okay maybe more than one m&em;



FINE LOTS OF MISTAKES

See, last time, it was [just boxes]({% post_url: first intersections post %}). Boxes are easy, which is why I didn't mess any of them up.



SHUT UP, STUPID WEBSITE.

Anyway, the obvious problem is that three-dimensional forms aren't limited to boxes. People aren't made of boxes. If you are made of boxes, seek help from a medical professional.

When you start bringing three-dimensional curves into the mix, things tend to get complicated. And when you have curves intersecting with _other_ curves, things get cray. Pardon my French.

Of course, this is all part of the whole "learning" thing. I'm supposed to make mistakes! And, since I'm working entirely in [ink](http://drawabox.com/article/ink), those mistakes will sit on the page and stare me in the face, forcing me to acknowledge them. "Hey, Paul!" they chirp, like chicks in a nest. "We're ugly and it's your fault! Our existence is a nightmare. Why did you create us? Please, have mercy!"

I am, of course, happy with some of the intersections here, and I definitely got a lot more comfortable trying to draw in three-dimensional space. But why dwell on the positives? Let's go into the major mistakes I found across all of my intersection exercises.

### Mistake 1: Bad, Bad Ellipses ###

This is entirely a mechanical practice issue. Look at this thing:



What are you doing there, faint line? Why are you in the middle of the circle? Nobody knows, except that I know, and it's because my arm sometimes jerks when drawing round shapes instead of moving smoothly.

aside: another example

Sometimes this isn't an issue, though. Check out this bad boy:

That is one tight ellipse. That bad boy is tighter than a tight end closing a pickle jar too hard while crawling through one of those [claustrophobia-inducing tiny caves](https://www.google.com/#q=tight+cave).

I just need to practice more. Right now, all of my warmups consist of straight lines, so I should probably throw more ellipse exercises in there.

### Mistake 2: Not Drawing Ellipses At All ###

"Oh, Paul," you're saying, shaking your head like a disappointed father. "You _just_ talked about drawing ellipses. Go home, you are obviously drunk on drugs."

First off, let me say this: You're not my real dad! _I hate you!_

Secondly, I both did and didn't draw enough ellipses in these exercises. See, when a flat plane intersects with a curved surface that it loves very much, its intersection looks like an ellipse drawn along that plane:
