title: "Sausages, Sausages, and More Sausages"
---

It’s been close to a month since my last post, and for good reason: I haven’t made nearly as much progress as I would have liked.

I hear you judging me. Why are you judging me? STOP JUDGING ME, IMAGINARY JUDGMENTAL BLOG AUDIENCE.

My wife and I have had a busy last few weeks. We traveled back to our hometown to visit family and friends. Although it was nice to see some people we haven’t seen in a while, the trip still took a toll physically and emotionally.

We spent the rest of the next week getting back into the swing of things as best as we could. Then, last weekend, we had a friend come into town to visit _us_. Guess how much art practice I got done in that time? Here’s a hint: I did not get any art practice done in that time. And then I didn’t practice much for a while because reasons.

Look, I’m just making excuses at this point. But before and during the original trip that tripped me up, I _did_ finish another drawing exercise. I drew me a whole mess of…uh…let’s call them “sausages.”

Look at those things. Sausage on top of sausage on top of sausage. Like some sort of party. A party of sausages.

<put a winky face and party hat on a sausage>

Some of you might see this drawing and be very confused. Some of you might be hungry. Some of you might be aroused. I can understand; I was _all of those things_ while drawing this.

Uh, except for the third thing. I didn’t say “aroused,” I said _“aroused.”_ Jeez, no, wait, I meant “aroused.”

Oh man oh jeez SHUT UP.

So why draw these sausages? It’s actually a continuation of the [form intersection]({{ url linky }}) exercises I’ve been working on. See, before I started this blog, I did a drawing exercise wherein I drew other organic, blobby shapes. Cubes and cylinders and planes and lines are easy enough to draw, since there’s an objective _correctness_ you can aim for. But organic shapes are a lot more free-form.

<example>

Look at that thing. Did I draw it correctly, or did I make a fundamental mistake? Trick question! The answer is “aroused.”

ANYWAY

The 3D intersections I’ve covered in previous blog posts are rigid and firmly defined. They teach you how to start thinking about how shapes exist in three dimensions with fundamental shapes. This exercise is all about how _organic_ forms can coexist in three dimensions.

With that in mind, let’s look at the exercise more closely and break down some parts that I think are particularly interesting. As always, check out the [BIG HUGE]() version of the image here.

### Thing 1: Paul Is Getting Better At Blobs ###

I know! I’m as surprised as you are. But check it out:

<image of old blobs>

This was my very first pass at the organic forms exercise. They just don’t really convey the idea of a  blobby form in three dimensions. They feel flat and lifeless.

I drew two more pages of these blobs before moving on to textures, then to intersections, then finally to Sausage Land. But just look at those sausages again. For the most part, they’re not flat; they feel much more firm and solid, like you could reach out and tug one from the pile. Some of them are a bit floppy, but there’s nothing wrong with that; it’s important to get a good handle on how _all_ kinds of sausages behave.

Of course, there’s not much of a market for drawings of sausages (flaccid, turgid, or otherwise), but I’m still happy to see my work improving. It’s really more about skills development than money.

### Thing 2: Paul Didn’t Plan Well Enough ###

The goal of this exercise was to draw a sausage pile. Obviously, I had to start this drawing _somewhere_. I started with the biggest sausage right in the middle. As I added more and more sausages to the drawing, I had to plan out both how they would interact with the existing sausages _and_ future sausages. Would they lay on top of each other? Would they just barely touch? Which one would be on top? Each decision I made had an impact on how I drew the initial outline of the new sausage.

Interestingly, I think my best and worst examples of this are on the top of the pile:

<good one>

Look at that cute little guy, just hanging out. It looks like it’s sitting on top of that other sausage properly. It just _feels_ right.

<bad one>

Now, for contrast. Look at how it unnaturally arches over the gap between two other sausages. It almost looks like it’s uncomfortable with the situation and wants to leave.

### Thing 3: Some Kinds Of Lines Are Just Crazy Helpful ###

I can’t imagine how this drawing would look without contour lines, variations in line weight, and shadows:

- Contour lines help further describe each sausage in 3D.
- Darkening some lines and leaving other lines lighter helps show which lines are dominant over others.
- Shadows help make each sausage pop out from what’s behind it.

Without these three things, this drawing would be a bunch of flat blobs on top of each other. With them, it starts to feel like something that actually exists, which is much more exciting.

A single light source and more detailed shadows could help this feel even more alive and exciting, but nuts to that; this isn’t a polished, finished piece. Also I would probably mess it up. One art skill at a time; I don’t think I can take two at the same time.

### There Is No Thing 4 ###

Just three things, mostly because there’s only one page to really analyze. I’ve actually submitted this homework to the Draw A Box creator already and gotten feedback. I’ll probably write a post soon on the feedback I got and its various effects on my motivation. It was arousing, but sometimes arousing feedback can make you feel aroused and make it seem like you don’t have to aroused anymore.
