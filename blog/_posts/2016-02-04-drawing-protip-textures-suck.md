I'm trying to learn to draw.

I've drawn before. I've just never drawn _well_. I made a silly comic strip for a while and posted itonline. The quality was...

<aside class="midtext-center"><img alt="An old comic panel" src="/assets/drawing-example-old-comic.png"/></aside>

...questionable.

To be fair, I learned a lot about making that _exact_ comic style look better than it did when I started, but I had no clear concept of how to show volume, proportion, or texture. I sketched and scribbled and experimented until I had something passable that I could ink. Then I corrected all of my inking mistakes with Photoshop. I was drawing by the seat of my pants.

Recently, however, I discovered Irshad Karim's excellent [Draw A Box](http://www.drawabox.com) lessons, which start with the _absolute_ basics. Lines. Planes. Ellipses. Practice. Drill. Drill. Get that arm to know what the hell to do when your brain wants a line from _here_ to _there_. No, of COURSE your arm doesn't want to draw a straight line. Your arm is stupid. Learn how to tell your stupid, stupid arm to shut up and draw what your smart brain wants.

I've made measurable progress, which makes me happy. I went from drawing circles and lines to drawing oblong organic forms. I was truckin'. And then I started working on [dissections](http://drawabox.com/lesson/2). 

"Oh, cool!" I said to myself, young and naive. "Finally, I can start drawing real-world object patterns!"

And so I chose reference photos. "But," I thought to myself, "the objects I choose should have interesting textures, or else I won't learn anything. Hmm. What has an interesting texture?"

"Yes, of course! Leather! Fantastic idea, Paul. Have a pat on the back!"

It took about ten seconds of drawing to realize my mistake. Or, rather, to realize my hubris: while leather does indeed have an "interesting" texture, recreating that texture with a pen is SO HARD.

I made notes. I sketched experiments. I had it figured out.

I started drawing. _I did not have it figured out._ I took more notes. I attempted to uncover the Grand Unified Damned Theory of Leather. I started drawing again, in a different place this time. It looked weird. I doubled down. "Surely," I thought, "surely this will start to look better as I add more detail."

I ended up with this:

It looks like a texture. It looks rough and uncomfortable. It does not look like leather. I  suddenly realized I had drawn in an area of the drawing that was supposed to be blank.

My arm would like a word with my brain about who is smart and who is stupid.
