I'm trying to learn to draw.

For a while now, I've been following the Irshad Karim's excellent [Draw A Box](http://www.drawabox.com) lessons, which start with the absolute basics. Lines. Planes. Ellipses. Practice. Drill. Drill. Get that arm to know what the hell to do when your brain wants a line from _here_ to _there_.
