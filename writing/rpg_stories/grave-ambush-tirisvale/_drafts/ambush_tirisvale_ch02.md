Chadwick lifted his head from the ground. His ears rang. Dimly he could see Derfin stirring behind nearby cover. The majority of the courtyard was clouded in thick smoke. Mnetally, he probed his connection to NGE. She seemed mostly unharmed, and informed Chad that she had taken the liberty of hiding inside the Alchemists' Society doorway when the torch fell.

Gavin and Chomsky slowly got up as well. The ringing began to fade.

"--RIGHT IN THE FACE! Fuck _yes_, eat shit goblins, eat my _arrow shit_!"

Derfin seemed to have recovered more quickly than the others. Gavin tried to remember. Was Elven Fortitude a thing? Or was that for dwarves? Whatever.

The smoke began to clear. Slowly the courtyard came back in to view, largely unscathed from the explosion. The goblin corpses were the opposite of unscathed. Charred bodies littered the ground. Here and there sat an errant limb; Derfin noted that one goblin's head had made it all the way up to a nearby roof. Besides the five members of the group, nothing made any motion. The sounds of combat had disappeared. The goblin attack was resoundingly defeated. 

Chad hopped up, seemingly recovered. "Damn, guys. Nice job on that climactic final battle!" He rubbed his hands together. "Any of you know what time it is?"

Chomsky checked his pocketwatch. "It's, uh, half past--"

"It's LOOTIN' time!" said Chad, bounding towards the nearest corpse. "Man, Derfin, I bet that one you Groucho'd up there had some sweet-ass ring, or maybe that shawl is cursed to make the wearer think it's fashionable." He rooted through the charred clothes.

Derfin glanced around. "I mean, I guess we can loot all of these bodies if there's nothing left for us to do."

Chad glared at Derfin. "_No_. There is _nothing left to do_."

"STOP! THIEF!" cried a voice. It came from the direction of the main road, back the way the group had come.

"What was that?" said Gavin. "Sounds like something cool over that way!"

"NOPE." Chadwick struggled with the belt buckle on his corpse. "Nope nothing, sounds like exactly nothing at all. We killed all of these goblins, and now we get their stuff, good thing there's nothing to distract us _at all_."

"Someone help!" cried a second voice from the same alleyway. "Anybody! Please, stop what you might be doing and assist us!"

Silently, Derfin ran back to the main road with Gavin close behind. Chad stared after them. "But..." he pleaded. "But dead goblins! Money!" 

Chomsky finished sawing the middle finger off of one of the goblins, stowed it in his pocket, and followed the others.

Chad looked at the goblins, then the road, then back at the goblins. NGE ran past him, following the group. Chad threw his hands in the air. "GOD! FINE!" He ripped the belt off of the goblin and ran.

Derfin arrived back at the main road. Across from him, the smaller street continued. There were no signs that any of the goblins had followed this path, however.

At the corner of the street was a simple woorden building. The door was hanging from one hinge; above it, a neatly-lettered sign proclaimed "MUSEUM: Myrv's Collection of the Esoteric and Discussable." A bespectacled dwarven man was slumped on the ground before the door, his clothing soaked in blood. A robed woman knelt over him, murmuring; golden light played around her hands.

Derfin noted all of this as he crossed the road at a run. Behind him he could hear his companions catching up. He called to the woman. "What happened? Who did this?"

She didn't take her eyes off of the wounded dwarf in front of her. "Someone dressed in black robbed and stabbed this man. Valeros chased him alone down this road, the fool. I cannot leave this man, and our other companions are helping the townspeople."

"Understood," said Derfin. Gavin was just catching up, and Derfin could see Chomsky, NGE, and Chad making their way down the road. "Bad guy! Black clothes! Good guy fighting him! Cemetery!" Derfin called to the group, then set off again without waiting for them to catch up.

It was late afternoon when the caravan first arrived in Tirisvale; it was now twilight. Derfin could see the iron fence surrounding the cemetery ahead. In the cemetery center, two figures were locked in a duel.

"Fiend! You may have escaped the museum, but you cannot escape _justice!_" cried one of the figures as he hacked at his opponent. Derfin reasoned that only someone who called themselves "Valeros" would talk like that. Valeros wore scaled armor and wielded two swords: one a worn shortsword with plain markings, and the other a shining steel longsword with a golden hilt. He had fierce green eyes and a nose  crossed with scars; his unkempt dark hair flipped across his face as he turned to parry a blow. Despite his bluster, he wielded both blades with skill.

"Haha holy shit did you just actually say that?" laughed Valeros' foe. "Man, I _actually_ don't want to kill you. Just walk away! It's really, really not hard to do!" He was tall and lanky, with brown hair pulled into a ponytail. He wore a lopsided grin as he danced around Valeros' attacks, parrying and feinting with skill rivaling his opponent. The blade of his sword caught Derfin's eyes: no light reflected off of it. A shadowy aura followed the blade along its arcs.

Derfin surveyed the terrain. The fence around the cemetery was sturdy, and climbing it looked difficult. The gate was closed by a locked chain.

The others had caught up as Derfin surveyed the scene. "Who?" Chad wheezed, out of breath from the quick pace.

"I'm guessing the bad guy is the guy all in black with the evil sword and the crazy eyes?" asked Chomsky.

Derfin declined to answer the obvious question.
