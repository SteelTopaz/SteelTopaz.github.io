Chadwick lifted his head from the ground. His ears rang. Dimly he could see Derfin stirring behind nearby cover. The majority of the courtyard was clouded in thick smoke. He mentally probed his connection to NGE. She seemed mostly unharmed, and informed Chad that she had taken the liberty of hiding inside the Alchemists' Society doorway when the torch fell.

Gavin and Chomsky slowly got up as well. The ringing began to fade, and they could hear again.

"--RIGHT IN THE FACE! Fuck _yes_! Eat shit, goblins, eat my _arrow shit_!"

Derfin seemed to have recovered more quickly than the others. Gavin tried to remember. Was Elven Fortitude a thing? Or was that for dwarves? Whatever.<!--more-->

The smoke began to clear. Slowly the courtyard came back into view, largely unscathed from the explosion. The goblin corpses, however, were extremely scathed. Charred bodies littered the ground. Here and there sat an errant limb; Derfin noted that one goblin's head had made it all the way up to a nearby roof. Except for the five members of the group, nothing moved. The sounds of combat had dissipated. The goblin attack had been resoundingly defeated. 

Chad hopped to his feet, suddenly energized. "Damn, guys. Nice job on that climactic final battle!" He rubbed his hands together. "Any of you know what time it is?"

Chomsky checked his pocketwatch. "It's, uh, half past--"

"It's LOOTIN' time!" exclaimed Chad, bounding towards the nearest corpse. "Man, Derfin, I bet that one you Groucho'd up there had some sweet-ass ring, or maybe that shawl is cursed to make the wearer think it's fashionable." He rooted through charred clothes.

Gavin looked at Chomsky and mouthed, "Groucho'd?" Chomsky shrugged, unsheathed his belt knife, and walked to a nearby corpse.

Derfin glanced around. "I mean, I guess we can loot all of these bodies if there's nothing left for us to do."

Chad glared at Derfin. "_No_. There is _nothing left to do_."

"STOP! THIEF!" cried a voice. It came from the direction of the main road, back the way the group had come.

"What was that?" said Gavin. "Sounds like something cool over that way!"

"NOPE." Chadwick struggled with the belt buckle on his corpse. "Nope, nothing, sounds like exactly nothing at all. We killed all of these goblins, and now we get their stuff, good thing there's nothing to distract us _at all_."

"Someone help!" cried a second voice from the same alleyway. "Anybody! Please, stop any looting you might be doing and assist us!"

Silently, Derfin ran back to the main road with Gavin close behind. Chad stared after them. "But..." he pleaded. "But dead goblins! Money!" 

Chomsky was finished cutting the middle finger off of one of the goblins, stowed it in his pocket, and followed the others.

Chad looked at the goblins, then the road, then back at the goblins. NGE ran past him, following the group. Chad threw his hands in the air. "GOD! FINE!" He ripped the belt off of the goblin and ran.

------

Derfin arrived back at the main road. Across from him, the smaller street continued. There were no signs that any goblins had gone down that road.

At the corner of the street was a simple woorden building. The door hung crookedly from one hinge; above it, a neatly-lettered sign proclaimed "MUSEUM: Myrv's Collection of the Esoteric and Discussable." A bespectacled dwarven man was slumped on the ground before the door, his clothing soaked in blood. A robed woman knelt over him, murmuring; golden light played around her hands.

Derfin noted all of this as he crossed the road at a run. Behind him he could hear his companions catching up. He called to the woman. "What happened? Who did this?"

She didn't take her eyes off of the wounded dwarf in front of her. "Someone dressed in black robbed and stabbed this man. Valeros, fool as he is, chased him alone down this road. I cannot leave this man, and our other companions are helping the townspeople."

"Understood," said Derfin. Gavin was just catching up, and Derfin could see Chomsky, NGE, and Chad making their way down the road. "Bad guy! Black clothes! Good guy fighting him! Cemetery!" Derfin called to the group, then set off again without waiting for them to catch up.

It was late afternoon when the caravan first arrived in Tirisvale; it was now twilight. Derfin could see the iron fence surrounding the cemetery ahead. In the cemetery center, two figures were locked in a duel.

"Fiend! You may have escaped the museum, but you cannot escape _justice!_" cried one of the figures as he hacked at his opponent. Derfin reasoned that only someone who called themselves "Valeros" would talk like that. Valeros wore scaled armor and wielded two swords: one a worn shortsword with plain markings, and the other a shining steel longsword with a golden hilt. He had fierce green eyes and a nose  crossed with scars; his unkempt dark hair flipped across his face as he turned to parry a blow. Despite his bluster, he wielded both blades with skill.

"Haha holy shit did you just actually say that?" laughed Valeros' foe. "Man, I _actually_ don't want to kill you. Just walk away! It's really, really not hard to do!" He was dressed all in black, because _of course he was_. He was tall and lanky, with brown hair pulled into a ponytail. He wore a lopsided grin as he danced around Valeros' attacks, parrying and feinting with skill rivaling his opponent. The blade of his sword caught Derfin's eyes: no light reflected off of it. A shadowy aura followed the blade as it arced through the air. His free hand was clenched into a fist. Shadows seeped out from between his fingers.

Derfin surveyed the terrain. The fence around the cemetery was sturdy, and climbing it looked difficult. The gate was closed and chained. Derfin rattled the gate. Locked.

The noise attracted the attention of the combatants. "Hah!" Valeros exclaimed. "You're no match for all of us, evildoer!" He dodged the shadowy blade and struck back.

His opponent dodged and laughed again. "Dude, _seriously_ where did you come up with these lines? Did you read the _Short-Lived Fighter's Big Book of Things to Say Right Before Dying_?"

Derfin called to Valeros as the others caught up. "We'll be there in a second!"

"Who?" Chad wheezed, out of breath from the quick pace.

"I'm guessing the bad guy is the guy all in black with the evil sword and the crazy eyes?" asked Chomsky.

Derfin declined to answer the obvious question. "Valeros needs help. We need to get through this gate."

NGE strode forward and raised her sword. She struck at the chains with all her might.

Nothing happened, except that the sword hitting the chains produced the most awful screech imaginable. Valeros slashed the dark-clothed man across his free arm. "FUCK," the man yelled. "Shit FUCK that hurt."

NGE smashed the chains again. Nothing.

Valeros kicked his opponent in the stomach. The man dropped to his knees, and Valeros lunged and stepped on the man's sword, trapping it. He held his own sword to the man's throat.

"Well damn," said Chomsky. "Looks like he didn't need us after all."

Valeros locked eyes with his foe. "This ends here, monster. Return what you have taken and face justice."

The man grinned up at Valeros. "Nah, I think I'm good." He grabbed Valeros' sword arm with his free hand, freeing the shadows. Valeros screamed and dropped his weapons as darkness rushed up his arm. His eyes turned black.

"Oh," said Chad. "Shit."

"Huh!" exclaimed Chomsky. "You know, for half a second I wondered if saying that he had won would make him _lose_, but then I did it anyway just to see what would happen. Cool!"

"FUCKING NOT COOL AT ALL, ACTUALLY," Gavin explained.

Derfin had no comment, partially because he enjoyed watching humans die, and partially because he had finally realized something: neither of the combatants could possibly have had time to chain and lock the gate. They had to have gotten in a different way. He looked at the ground and saw tracks leading around the fence to the left. "This way! We can get in!" he called as he ran, following the tracks.

"Aw, darn. You figured it out," said the man in black. He picked up his sword and plunged it into Valeros' chest. The sword's shadowy aura engulfed him, and he collapsed to the ground, unmoving.

"Valeros noooo," said Chad faintly.

"It's cool," said Chomsky. The group had reached a section of broken fence. "He's got that cleric friend back there, she can probably heal him up just fine."

The man in black touched Valeros' forehead and spoke an incantation. His flesh rippled and writhed.

"Hm," said Chomsky. "Maybe not." The group ran through the opening in the fence. The man in black turned to face them.

With a sickening squelch, Valeros' skeleton wrenched itself out of his flesh. It picked up his longsword and stood to face the group. One eye still hung from its socket, and bits of flesh and sinew clung to the bones.

"Well, that's genuinely horrifying," said Gavin.

"Aw, you think so?" asked the man in black in a singsong voice. "Thaaaaaanks! Valeroskeleton, kill them. Or just slow them down, I don't really care. Peace, losers!" He ran for the stone city wall at the rear of the cemetery.

The Valeroskeleton lurched towards them. Chomsky laughed. "Where does he think he's going? The gate is solid everywhere else."

Derfin wasn't taking any chances. He put an arrow to string and fired. The arrow grazed the man's leg, but he seemed not to care. He pulled a piece of chalk from his pocket and crouched by the wall. In a single brisk movement, he drew a human-sized arc along the wall, ending back at the ground.

Suddenly there was a tunnel in the wall. The man waved, flipped off the group, and ran through the tunnel. It closed behind him.

Chad was furious. "God damn it! This was a stupid 'the villain gets away' fight the whole time!" He took his feelings out on Valeroskeleton and shot it with his crossbow. The bolt pinged off of the skeleton's tibia, inflicting zero damage. Chad ignored this fact and loaded a second bolt.

The entire group unloaded their considerable might onto the skeleton. NGE hacked with her sword; Derfin fired an arrow; Gavin unleashed a volley of magical projectiles; Chomsky recited portions of "Skeletons - Fuck 'Em: A Theoretical Framework Of Their General Shitness" from memory, empowering the team.

Fortunately for the skeleton, none of these attacks did anything at all. Unfortunately, it was wildly incompetent with a sword. It swung at NGE, the only one within reach; she dodged with ease.

"Okay, so, like, what?" said Gavin. "We fight this thing forever?"

"Nah," Derfin said. He pulled several cloth-tipped arrows from his pack. He struck a match and touched it to the arrowheads, which burst into flame.

"Fuck _yes_," said Chad. Derfin fired one arrow. It lodged in the skeleton's ribcage. NGE chopped at the skeleton's leg. It came loose at the knee, and the skeleton fell to the ground.

Derfin walked closer and fired a second arrow. The arrow stuck in an eye socket. The skeleton's bones began to pop and crack from the heat. NGE lined up a shot and swung one last time, cleaving the Valeroskull in half.

Valeroskeleton was defeated. The group took a moment to catch their breath.

Chad looked at Derfin. "Hey, Elf Senses. Hear any more fighting? Anyone else that needs our help?"

"The _fuck_ did you just call me?" said Derfin. "And why do you ask?"

"I'll take that as a 'no.'" Chad walked to Valeros' fleshy remains and knelt. "Because I am going to loot the _shit_ out of this corpse."
