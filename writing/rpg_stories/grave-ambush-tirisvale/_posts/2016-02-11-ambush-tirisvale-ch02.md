NGE entered the city, and the rest of the group followed behind. Before them lay the main road of Tirisvale. It was clear that there had been heavy fighting here, but there was little left to fight. It looked as if the battle had progressed down the main road. The group ran ahead, with Chadwick casting longing glances at the unlooted corpses they were leaving behind.

The sounds of fighting drew their attention to an intersecting street. Overturned carts of various goods cluttered the lane; clearly this was a market. Far down the street was a goblin with a headdress and a crude staff, flanked by two bodyguards.

In between our heroes and the goblin trio was a large stall. Two humans had clearly used the stall as cover, but one of them lay still on the ground.

"Derfin!" called Chad, snickering. "What do your elf eyes see?"

Derfin glanced askance at Chad. "The exact same fucking thing your human eyes see. Those guys are, like, ten feet away."

Chomsky chimed in. "Yeah, but can't you, like, count how many testicles they each have or something?"

"And I'm _half_-human, thank you very much," added Chad.

Derfin decided that silence was the preferable option. Gavin silently agreed.

Meanwhile, the conscious human had dropped her sword and was tending to a nasty arrow wound on the fallen man. "Come on, Pitt," she said. "You've been through so much, you can't--"

"SHIT." said Chad. "That's Pitt? We have to help him! He has our money!"

"Well, yeah," said Derfin. "That's why I already killed both of those bodyguards."

Chadwick peered down the street. The goblin mage was indeed looking panicked at the fact that both of his companions had sprouted more than the usual number of arrows in their necks.

The entire party had, however, missed the fourth goblin hiding on the other side of the stall. Shrieking with rage, he leaped over the stall and lunged for Pitt's as-yet-unstabbed face.

"MAYBE DON'T DO THAT," said Chomsky.

His voice had changed. Or, rather, it hadn't. It was still grating, high-pitched, and generally infuriating, but suddenly all of those qualities just seemed like the _best_ things a voice could have. The others felt it, but the goblin seemed to be afflicted most of all. He stopped short of Pitt, smiling benignly.

Chadwick, Derfin, and Gavin all stared at the gnome.

"Oh, yeah, forgot to mention. My voice is magic? I guess? I can sometimes make people do what I want them to."

"Welp," said Chad. "That's terrifying. NGE, go cut that other goblin in half."

NGE darted down the lane. The panicked goblin mage began to cast a spell or something, nobody really cared. It waved its stupid little goblin stick around stupidly.

Chomsky decided that the mage was a threat, and that NGE coud use help. He cleared his throat and spoke again to the enthralled goblin. "YOU SHOULD CALL YOUR FRIEND OVER HERE."

From behind the stall came the unmistakable sounds of a goblin being cut in half. A few seconds later, Chomsky's goblin decided to act. "Hey!" he yelled shrilly to his deceased ally. "Quick, come here!"

Gavin looked skeptically at Chomsky. He skeptically pointed a finger at the remaining goblin, expanded his skeptical pupils to engulf his eyes in empty blackness, and spoke a skeptical eldritch invocation that smelled faintly of icy decay. The goblin promptly froze to death.

With the area safe, Chadwick rushed to Pitt's side. "Thank the gods we made it in time," he said to Pitt. "Is this a good time to talk payment?"

Pitt said nothing, because he was fucking unconscious. "He's fucking unconscious, you dick," said the woman next to Pitt, helpfully.

"Balls," said Chad. He busied himself with looting the frigid corpse of the goblin next to him.

"_Also_," said the woman, "A much larger group of goblins continued down that way!" She pointed down a wide lane past the market. "I think they're-"

"SCORE!" interrupted Chad. "Alchemist's fire!" He proudly held aloft a bottle marked "EXTREMELY VOLATILE. DO NOT JUGGLE."

"Yes, but they--"

"More goblins to shoot over that way? Awesome," said Derfin. He walked briskly down the lane, followed closely by Gavin and Chomsky. Chadwick looked mournfully at the rest of the unlooted bodies. He contented himself with grabbing the stupid goblin mage's stupid little staff as he ran to catch up with his colleagues.
