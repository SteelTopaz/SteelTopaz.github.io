The group followed overturned carts and carnage down the road. Here and there they found evidence of fighting: discarded arrows, crossbow bolts, splashes of blood. A single goblin lay dead against the Temple of Ior. Suspicious eyes looked out from the temple windows.

Derfin ignored all distractions, determined to find goblins to kill. He followed the trail with the trail-following skills of someone skilled at following trails. Finally he raised his arm at an intersection. 

Chad walked into him. <!--more-->Derfin glared. "What?" said Chad. "Was the arm supposed to mean something? Shit, man, we're not in a war or anything, these are just some goblin chumps."

"Don't underestimate goblins," Derfin said darkly. "They can be cunning little bastards. Look where they've gone." He gestured to the diverging path. To their left, the road wound between two small grassy fields studded with trees before emptying into the town square. In front of them, the road dead-ended at the Tirisvale branch of the Royal Alchemists' Society. The building's granite facade looked out over a flagstone courtyard, stern and powerful. The entrance to the Society was set several feet aboveground, accessible by a small staircase.

The road through the field was smooth and untrampled. The road to the Alchemists' Society was littered with debris and bloody goblin footprints, and the wooden doors were flung wide open.

Gavin raised an eyebrow. "The Alchemists' Society? That was their goal here?"

"Makes sense," said Chad, nodding wisely. "There's probably plenty of super valuable stuff in there, not to mention magical potions." He lowered his voice. "Just imagine a goblin raiding party hopped up on Enlarge Person potions."

His words didn't exactly have the desired intent. Derfin smiled for the first time that day, presumably at the thought of easier arrow targets. Chomsky flushed slightly and bit his lower lip. "Gods," he said breathlessly. "They'd be so _huge_. They could just grab you, and--"

"ANYWAY THE GOBLINS COULD BE DANGEROUS," said Gavin loudly. "So we should prepare, right? Like, make sure we're ready for a serious, climactic fight before we charge in there?"

"Definitely," said Chad. "If they get the drop on us, we're _EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!_"

When recalling the event later, the others weren't sure whether the shriek they heard came from Chadwick or the rocket. They dove for the scant cover offered by the courtyard as the rocket detonated above them.

Goblins were swarming out of the doors to the Society. At the top of the stairs, a tall goblin wearing a furry shawl cackled and waved a torch. "Yes! Yesss! We take fireworks! We make boom!" Two smaller goblins pulled more rockets from a large wooden crate and set them in position.

"Oh man!" yelled Chomsky. "Explosives! How _cunning_!" He rifled through old lecture notes, looking for good battle material.

"YES THANK YOU," Chad yelled back, fitting a bolt into his crossbow. His symbol flashed a command, and NGE darted towards the stairs. Blue needles streaked past her, perforating two goblins that were charging the group's cover. Chomsky began reading aloud a passage from his lecture "On Goblins, And Why They Suck Just SO HARD, You Guys, You Have No Idea." His voice, annoying as it was, filled his companions with vigor.

Vigor nonwithstanding, Chad fired and missed. Derfin did not miss; one of the rocket goblins went down. The other two by the doors set off a barrage of rockets, which careened around the courtyard before exploding in multicolored fire. The remaining goblins cheered, seemingly content to sacrifice their lives for the sake of fireworks.

The group made short work of the goblins that had run towards them, and NGE cleaved the hell out of the rocket assistant goblin. She stood at the top of the stairs and faced the fur-shawled goblin, seemingly the leader of this raiding party.

The goblin hissed at NGE. "You longshanks think you win, but we win in the end! We be Grubchin! We have powerful friend, and you will-"

Derfin wasn't waiting for no last words. His arrow went just straight through that goblin's head, pinning her to the door.

Her torch fell into the box of fireworks.

"Oh," said Chad. "Oh _shi-_"

The courtyard exploded.
