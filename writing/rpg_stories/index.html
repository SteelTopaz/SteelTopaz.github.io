        <h1>RPG Short Stories</h1>
        <p>Some D&amp;D sessions end up being too damn funny to leave alone, so I write them up as short(ish) stories. I promise, only, like, <em>half</em> of the profanity is author-inserted. The rest was already there.</p>
        <p>Seriously, though, there are <strong>so many bad words</strong> ahead. And while there's no explicit adult content, there's definitely a non-trivial amount of innuendo. Just so's you know.</p>
