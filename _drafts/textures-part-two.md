title: Textures, Part 2: Paul Draws Your Nightmares
---

I have to give credit to a friend of mine for the title of this post. He had this to say about my [first dissection exercise]({% post_url 2016-02-18-did-paul-learn-textures %}):

Well, I've now completed a second set of dissections to fuel your nightmare cars for a while longer. You're welcome!

There's actually a slight chance that I'll have to do it all over again. Boy howdy, wouldn't that just be a treat? That would be so cool. I would scream, implode, eat my pen, and probably burst into flames (in no particular order).

### Why Am I Doing This? ###

I realize now that I haven't given much context for these drawings, except to mention the instructor and link his website. I'm going to explain a bit more, because I think he deserves more attention.

These dissections are a subset of a [larger lesson](http://drawabox.com/lesson/2) from [Draw A Box](http://www.drawabox.com). The instructor treats the site like an actual art class: the lessons start simple and tackle more and more complex ideas as you continue. He even assigns "homework" at the end of each lesson.

Once you complete all of the homework for an entire  lesson, you can submit it to his [reddit.com/r/artfundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/artfundamentals) (the subreddit for his course). He'll critique your work and tell you if you're ready to move on to the next lesson, or if you need to re-visit some of the concepts and submit the homework again.

He's doing this all for free, which is crazy cool of him. The only paywalled content are his videos (although if you contribute as little as $1 to his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/uncomfortable?ty=h), you get access to those as well).

That's why I'm drawing these things. I wanted to start from some kind of very basic, instructor-led process in order to learn new techniques and find out where my previous drawing was going wrong. The fact that I get to draw unthinkable abominations against man and nature is just a bonus.

### Unthinkable Abomination Against Man And Nature (UAAMAN) #1 ###

Behold the Tomatolog.

I started with the tree bark, and I have mixed feelings. On one hand, I think that the texture as a whole _does_ visually convey "tree bark." On the other hand, I relied too much on random scribblings instead of drawing similarly-themed shapes. I started with the idea of "scales" with large cracks in between them, and then tried to convey that the scales were formed from layers, but I think that was the wrong way to go.

The tomato part is the most interesting (to me) drawing on this whole page, because it's the drawing where a concept finally started to "click" for me. I started drawing the top half, and used hatching lines to try and show the concavity of the tomato - but tomatoes aren't empty. They're full of a liquidy, gelatinous substance. When I moved to the bottom of the tomato, I switched tactics: I tried to show where the light reflected off of the gel. It's absolutely not perfect, but I think I captured that good old  tomato-y feeling better in the bottom half than the top.

UAAMAN RATING: 1/5.

Tomatoes and logs are both plants. I can do better.

### UAAMAN #2 ###

SAND CHEESE.
