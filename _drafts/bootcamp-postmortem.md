title: "Emerging from the Lab: What's Next After Bootcamp"
---

Uh. Hello! It's been a _while_. Five years, in fact, since I've written on this dang site. It feels like much, much longer.

What have I been doing in the interim? I've been trying lots of new things. No, seriously. I've been:

- A [modestly successful Twitch streamer](link!)
- A [freelance writer](link!)
- A [tire changer](link?) (yes, really)
- A [tire changer but for a different company this time](link?)

And now, on the cusp of moving to Canada, I'm making the transition into a full-time professional software/web developer. Why such a hard pivot, you may ask? Two very important reasons:

1. I've loved computers and technology since I was very young, and I've kept coming back to programming over and over since I was a teenager. There's nothing quite like the feeling of typing a bunch of symbols into a computer and seeing it actually do something useful or fun.
2. Changing tires in Canadian winter is, in fact, the unwritten Tenth Circle of Hell, designed _specifically_ for my everlasting torment.

So what's a person with surface-level, hobbyist programming skills and a few months of quarantine to do? If you said "attend a web development bootcamp," then that was a really strange thing to do. Why are you talking to your monitor? This website can't hear you, and you probably accidentally instructed your Alexa or whatever to enroll you in an intensive three-month course in Javascript, SQL, Ruby, and other important web development languages and frameworks. You should double-check, and cancel it if necessary.

Unless you _want_ to take a web development bootcamp, which is what I just finished doing.

### Booting Up ###

After a bit of research into Toronto-area programming bootcamps, I joined up with [Lighthouse Labs](link!) for their three-month program that began on March 1. We started off with basic Javascript concepts: functions, objects, conditionals, arrays, and loops (abbreviated to FOCAL, although I would have preferred FALCO.)

I was already pretty familiar with most of these concepts, having dealt with basic programming structures since high school. They're the core building blocks of many programming languages. During this time, I felt like I breezed through the core work and the stretch work, often with plenty of time left in the day to relax.

I also spent a fair amount of time assisting other students in my cohort. This course was intended for people of _any_ skill level, meaning some of my peers had never done any sort of coding before. I wanted to try and use my existing experience to help anyone who asked!

I'm really glad I did, because I met a lot of my fellow students through bug hunting and troubleshooting. I also reinforced my own knowledge and discovered weak points when I would try to explain a concept and find out that I was missing something!
