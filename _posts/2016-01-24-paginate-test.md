This post exists to test Jekyll's pagination functionality. Hit the jump for more info!

Jekyll's pagination functionality populates each page of the blog with a certain number of posts. It creates each page individually and tracks the URL of each page. That way, someone who wants to scroll through several blog posts at a time is able to.

Ideally, I should also be able to create a master post listing at /blog/index.html. We'll see how that works out!
