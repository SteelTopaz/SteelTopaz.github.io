## Summary

Capensis is a combined scheduler and time-tracking application designed for personal accountability and time management. Capensis users can schedule projects they'd like to keep track of, track time on each project, and then view reports to see how much time they've tracked versus how much time they scheduled!

## Key Features

<!-- What important technologies, features, etc were in this project? -->
Capensis is a single-page app built with React on the frontend, and a PSQL database with a Node.js Express API on the backend. The backend server is deployed on Heroku, while the client is deployed on GitHub Pages.

Capensis's most important feature is the ability to reliably keep track of time on a per-project basis for each user. My implementation is pretty simple: just keep track of each "session" in the database with the user's ID, the project's ID, and the start and end times of the session. Clicking a project block either creates a new session or logs the end time for the current session.

The reporting feature is equally important; it's borderline useless for a user to be able to track time through the app if they can't see the results of that tracking! W
