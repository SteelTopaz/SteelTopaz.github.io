Hey there! I'm Paul Ladd, and I've been programming for over a decade. I like making things, breaking things, and fixing things, which is basically programming in a nutshell.

## Stuff I Can Do

I'm proficient in both front-end and back-end web development. Check out my [portfolio page]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio) for a full list of projects, or go straight to my [GitHub]({{ site.author.links[4].url }}) to see what I've been working on!

## Stuff I Love

In no particular order:

### Indie Games

The recent proliferation of tools and frameworks has made it possible for almost anyone to make a video game or other interactive experience, and that's incredible to me. I absolutely love how many different stories, experiences, and experiments have come out of the indie game world, and I'm excited to see what happens as technology continues to evolve.

### Cooking

Turning vegetables, meat, minerals, water, and heat into delicious things to eat? That's magical.

### Electronic Music

[Chiptune](https://chipzel.co.uk/), [chiller stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYZ9rknEmE4R1J_HBJ2yBlQ), [synthwave](https://247retro.bandcamp.com/album/zero-hour), [even chiller stuff](https://lightfrequency.bandcamp.com/album/advanced-pe-ep), you name it. All awesome. (Support independent musicians! Buy albums from [Bandcamp.com](https://bandcamp.com/)! This is not an ad, I just love what they do!)

### Learning New Stuff

I love, love, love to learn new things. New programming languages. New physical skills. New facts about...wait, the Greek prefix for "horse" is "hippo-"? 

Which means that "hippophobia" is an irrational fear of HORSES and not an irrational fear of HIPPOPOTAMUSES?

Okay, I love to learn _some_ new stuff.

### Dogs

I mean, [clearly]({{ site.baseurl }}/dog).
